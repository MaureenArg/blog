Several authors have highlighted the potential of PES to improve the capacity
to adapt and reduce vulnerability to climate change, both of ecosystems and the actors
dependent on them. Drawing upon the concepts of adaptive capacity, vulnerability and
social-ecological systems, PES can contribute to adaptation by enhancing the provision of ES
and the adaptive capacity according to how the PES is designed and implemented, and by
offering incentives to adopt certain measures for climate adaptation.
